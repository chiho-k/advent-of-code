Summary of the task for Day 1:

Find the calibration value hidden in each line of text by finding the first and second numbers in the text (found in calibration value.txt), then find the sum of all 1000 calibration codes. 

Part 1:
The calibration value is a number that combines the first and last numbers into a single two-digit number, e.g. a1b2c3d4e5f makes 15.

Part 2:
Single digit numbers written in text also count as digits for the calibration value e.g. 7pqrstsixteen makes 76. 

My solution requires the csv module.
