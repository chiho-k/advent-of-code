Summary of the task for Day 1:

Find the calibration value hidden in each line of text by finding the first and second numbers in the text (found in calibration value.txt), then find the sum of all 1000 calibration codes. 
The calibration value is a number that combines the first and last numbers into a single two-digit number, but it has to account for the fact that there are numbers written in text that also count as numbers for the calibration value.
