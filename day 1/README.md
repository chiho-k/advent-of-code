Summary of the task for Day 1:
Find the first and second numbers found in each line of text in the calibration codes (found in calibration value.txt). 
The calibration value is a number that combines the first and last numbers into a single two-digit number, but it has to account for the fact that there are numbers written in text that also count as numbers for the calibration value.
